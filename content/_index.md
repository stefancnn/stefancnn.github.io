        ## Vision — Why We Exist  
        To see the Gospel reach the ends of the earth and prepare the way for the return of Jesus Christ.

        ## Mission — What We Do  
        We empower believers to pray, give, and go — mobilizing a global movement to proclaim Christ to every nation, tribe, and tongue.

        All the signs point to Jesus returning soon. That’s why we act.  
        We refuse to stay idle while billions live without hope in Christ.
